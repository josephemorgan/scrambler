Ter'hes a post taht sowhs up on facoeobk somitemes taht clamis taht as lnog as 
the fisrt and lsat lrettes of a wrod are in thier ccreort poitsoins, it dosen't 
metatr what oedrr the rset of the lrettes are in; yuo'll sitll be albe to udeannrtsd 
tehm. The last time the psot peppod up on my feed, I setrtad to wonder if tihs was 
true for any airrrtbay input. Tihs porrgam severs to take a text file as an iunpt, 
and sabclrme the irntenal leettrs of ecah word, livenag the frist and lsat as they 
are. 

There's a post that shows up on facebook sometimes that claims that as long as
the first and last letters of a word are in their correct positions, it
doesn't matter what order the rest of the letters are in; you'll still be able
to understand them. The last time the post popped up on my feed, I started to
wonder if this was true for any arbitrary input. This program serves to take a
text file as an input, and scramble the internal letters of each word, leaving
the first and last as they are.



To test it yourself, run scrambler.out from a directory that contains a file
called <input.txt>. A file called output.txt will be created, (hopefully)
hopefully with the scrambled contents of input.txt.
